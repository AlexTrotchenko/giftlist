Create QuickAddForm component - simple dialog wrapper opening ItemFormDialog with URL in defaultValues\n2. Add Quick Add button (Link icon) next to existing Add Item button in WishlistPage\n3. Pass URL extraction logic to pre-fill ItemFormDialog\n4.

Add allowJs to tsconfig.json (simplest - allows .js imports)\n2. Run paraglide-js compile --project ./project.inlang manually\n3. Add postinstall script to package.json\n4. Check if @inlang/paraglide-js should generate .d.ts files","created_at":"2026-01-02T21:55:26Z"}]}
