Vite wasn't deduping React properly.\n\n4. **CJS/ESM conflict**: `module is not defined` error from React's CJS entry point being bundled in ESM context due to `ssr.noExternal: ['react', 'react-dom']` config.\n\n5. **Missing Clerk publishable key on client**: Clerk React components (SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton) not rendering because PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY was only in .dev.vars (Wrangler) but not in .env (Astro client-side).\n\n## Root Causes\n- Date objects don't serialize cleanly across Astro server → React client boundary\n- Vite config was over-specified, causing bundling issues\n- Astro uses .env for client-side public vars, .dev.vars is only for Cloudflare Workers runtime\n\n## Solution Applied\n1.
